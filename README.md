It looks like you've created a simple ERC20 token contract named `AlejandroToken`. This contract allows the owner (presumably set during deployment) to mint new tokens, transfer tokens, and burn tokens. 

Here's a breakdown of what your contract does:

1. **Constructor**: Sets the initial owner of the contract.

2. **Modifier `onlyOwner`**: Ensures that only the owner can call certain functions.

3. **Function `mint`**: Allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified account.

4. **Function `transfer`**: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to another address.

5. **Function `transferFrom`**: Allows approved addresses to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner.

6. **Function `burn`**: Allows token holders to burn (destroy) their own tokens.

To use this contract, you need to deploy it to the Ethereum network. You may also want to include a README file (`README.md`) to provide instructions on how to interact with your token, how to deploy it, and any other relevant information for users and developers.
